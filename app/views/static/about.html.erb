<h1>About Show Journal</h1>

<p>The idea for Show Journal came about during the COVID-19 health crisis, when most of us were homebound 
while practicing social distancing.  During this time, the Metropolitan Opera House announced that they would 
stream a recorded production from their archives every night for free.</p>
<p>Having always had an interest in opera and classical music, but never really having the opportunity to see many productions, 
I was thrilled to have these shows available.  As I started watching some of the nightly streams I thought it would be helpful 
to keep a journal with notes about each show, so I could start to better understand different composers and genres of opera.  And thus, 
Show Journal was created!</p>
